# These configurations are only used when running locally on your machine
# and don't apply for running on a remote server in automated test mode.

# GENERATE_LOCATION
# This sets the location that rubySelenium will generate the html.
# set it with the full path to the folder you want the tests to be generated into.
# e.g. C:/IBM/workspaces/SecureMessaging1/FunctionalTests/WebContent/tests/Ruby

# TEST_LOCATION
# This sets the location that rubySelenium should look for when running
# the tests locally. It should point to the url of where the tests live on
# your local server.
#
# e.g. if you navigate to
# http://localhost:9081/Selenium/tests/Ruby/tests/seleniumTestRunner.html
# to find your tests then you should set this property to
# http://localhost:9081/Selenium/tests/Ruby

TEST_LOCATION = http://localhost:8080/selenium-tests

# LOGGING
# This turns the log output on or off when using the generate command.
# When you run the generate command all the html is generated - this is
# for use when hooked up to the remote cruisecontrol driven automation.
# The logs show all the ruby code that is executed in order to create the html.
#
# set it to true or false to turn it on or off

# IE_LOCATION
# This is the location of your Internet Explorer executable (iexplore.exe)

# LOCAL_TEST_RESULTS
# After a test has run locally it will dump out the results to the testResults
# directory. You can turn this on or off here by setting it to either true or false.
